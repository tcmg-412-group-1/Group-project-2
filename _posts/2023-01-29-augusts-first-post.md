## About Me
My name is August Finger, and I'm a senior Tech Management major here at Texas A&M. I am excited to be taking this class. 
I've worked as a student worker here on campus in the Liberal Arts IT department for the past 1.5 years.

I am new to GitHub, so I hope to be experienced with GitHub when we finish this class. I am very grateful that we have the chance here to get to know how to use GitHub in a learning environment.

I trust that my fellow bloggers and I will be a great group this semester!


Looking forward to our next post!
