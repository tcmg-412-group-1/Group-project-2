Howdy, everyone!

Like all my fellow students, I'm very eager and excited to learn as much as I can in this course, Contemporary Issues in Technology Management.

I'm also particularly excited to be working with five obviously-talented colleagues: Ruby, Phan, August, Manny, and Zackary. We're not even two weeks into this course, and I'm already impressed with the knowledge and tenacity of these students. This is going to be a great semester!

I am a senior Technology Management student at Texas A&M University, with an expected graduation of Spring 2024. I am thirty-four years old, coming up on thirty-five soon, and I've worked full-time as an International Accounts Specialist at the same software company since 2013.

What defines me above anything else is that I'm a grateful husband to an `incredible woman` (who definitely settled), and I'm also an incredibly lucky father to three `beautiful and intelligent daughters` (14, 7, and 5). These four ladies are the reason I went back to school in my thirties -- determined to finish what I quit so long ago.

Thank you to anyone taking the time to read this brief bio. I look forward to working with you all!

Best,

Steve Nelson
