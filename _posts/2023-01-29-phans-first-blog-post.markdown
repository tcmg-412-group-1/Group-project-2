Howdy!!!

My name is Anh Phan, currently a member of TCMG 412 Group 1.

I am a Junior by year (but Senior by hour) from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, which makes me an international student. I will also be getting my Aggie Ring by the end of this Spring semester. 

So, A-Whoop but also A-A-A-Whoop?

Being in this class, I hope that the material that our group would learned and practice, would help grow and developed into our roles as technology managers. So far, I really have enjoyed the group project, as well as the assigned reading that speak about the problem within Developments and Operations.

A bit more about me would be that I'm a musician, and I played 5 different instrument and was a drum major for my high school marching band. I still practice them nowadays from time to time, but not much like before because I'll be moving around quite a lot as a student with no U.S. Residence.

Anyway, thank you for reading my bio, it's an honor to be in this class.

Best Regard,
Phan
