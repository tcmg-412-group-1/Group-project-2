Hello, everyone! I'm Ruby, a junior technology management student at Texas A&M University.

To be honest, I'm still having a hard time believing that this is actually happening.
I've been interested in both software development and system operations for more than a decade at this point, but to think that I'm taking a hands-on course on contemporary issues in technology management, with a wonderful team, no less, is nothing short of mindblowing.
While I seem to have accidentally stumbled into a leadership position, I still feel like for once, I've finally been pushed *into* my comfort zone.

It's one of the most liberating feelings I've ever felt.

As you might be able to guess, I love computers, and I take every chance I get to mess with them.
Recently, in my spare time (and otherwise, for better or worse), I've been working on a video game,
<a href="https://patchmixolydic.itch.io/devils-emergence"><ruby>東方魔出現 <rp>(</rp><rt>Touhou Mashutsugen</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> 〜 Devil's Emergence</a>.
It's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project">Touhou Project</a> fangame that tells the story of a war between humans and supernatural creatures from the perspectives of
an overconfident heroine, a supernatural peacekeeper, a veritable god among women, an incredibly powerful magician, a charming thief, and a clueless lesbian.
Over the course of two years[^1], it's taught me a lot about writing large, maintainable codebases.
The current demo's a little old, but feel free to check it out!

Just... please don't make fun of the art. Drawing isn't my strong suit ^^;

Between this incredible course and the progress I'm (slowly) making on my personal project, this promises to be a great semester. I can't wait to get to work!

Until then, take care! See you next time~!

[^1]: That seems outrageous, but in my defense, [I did write my own engine for this game](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/maniacal).
