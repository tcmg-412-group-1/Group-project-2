Howdy!
My name is Manuel (but I go by Manny).
I'm currently an IT Engineer, but am new to the developing environment.

I hope the title didn't alarm you.
As an inexperienced developer, I am totally winging this in hopes I'm doing it correctly.
I do, however, have an awesome team that I am confident will guide me in the right direction!

In any case, welcome to our blog!

I look forward to learning with everyone this semester in hopes to build a solid DevOps foundation.

God Bless and Gig 'Em!
