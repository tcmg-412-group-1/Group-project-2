Howdy!
I hope the title didn't alarm you.
As an inexperienced developer, I am totally winging this in hopes I'm doing it right.
I do, however, have an awesome team that I am confident will guide me in the right direction!
 
In any case - Welcome to our blog post!
I look forward to learning with everyone this semester in hopes to build a solid DevOps foundation.

God Bless and Gig 'Em!
