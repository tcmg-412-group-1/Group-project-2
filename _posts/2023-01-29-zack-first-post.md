Howdy to whoever is reading this!

My name is Zackary but most people just call me Zack.

I have a little experience with coding, but not a lot of experience with GitHub since most of coding projects have been solo projects. Luckily, I have a great group that has more knowledge than me in both aspects. I am  hoping to learn a lot from them. 

I am currently looking for a Technology Management related job on campus or at least in the College Station and Bryan area. 

This class will be a great class for me and has already taught me a few things I didn't know. 

Thank you for viewing my first blog post!
